## ⚡ **About Me**

I’m a student at ZSEII in Sosnowiec, where I’ve been studying IT for 4 years. For the past 8 years, I’ve been developing my skills in web development, currently focusing on creating web applications using React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js for the backend. I also work on mobile app projects after school.

My interests mainly revolve around technology and sports, especially basketball. I train on my own, which not only helps me stay balanced but also teaches me discipline and perseverance—qualities I apply to my work and projects. This makes me ready for challenges that require both mental and physical effort.

## 📢 **Information**
I am currently seeking employment opportunities, with an interest in various roles, not necessarily related to IT. My preferred locations are Sosnowiec or the Katowice area, though I am also open to remote work.
